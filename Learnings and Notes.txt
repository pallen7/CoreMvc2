https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/upload-files?view=aspnetcore-2.2
Is 3rd Party verification for file upload required if replacing sftp? (I.e. by the banks, clients, sellers) - Possible example: https://www.filestack.com/ - Does Azure offer this?
For a user to upload a file they would have to be a registered user. As uploading files presents so many security loopholes what is the User registration strategy? Can anybody log on to upload a file?
